Non-ergodic adjustment factors used in the example hazard calculation.

file: "France_SSC_V5b.xlsx"
This file contains the source characteriztion for the zoness for the example hazard calculation
The file is in the format for program HAZ45. 

file: "Adj_RE_site1_5Hz_Sa10.xlsx"
This file contains the 100 realizations, mean, and std dev of the non-ergodic torms for each source location
column 1:  index of the source location
column 2: latitude of the source
column 3: longitude of the source
column 4: non-ergodic adjustment (in LN units) for realization 1 
coulmn 5: non-ergodic adjustment (in LN units) for realizatoin 2
... repeatd for 100 relization
column 104: mean non-ergodic adjustment (LN units)
column 105: std dev of non-ergodic adjustment (LN units)

file: "eas_5Hz for haz"
This file contains the median and std dev of the EAS (in g-s) for M6 and 5 Hz
